# Predicting-Air-Quality-Index-using-Machine-Learning-Models

The project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) by training a model with six months' worth of concentration data for various air components in a specific location. The collected data serves as the foundation for training the system to identify patterns and correlations that affect air quality.

By following a structured approach, the project involves several key steps. First, data collection involves gathering data on different air components, such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and other pollutants, over a six-month period. Next, the collected data undergoes preprocessing to ensure its quality and compatibility with machine learning algorithms. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and noise removal.

Feature engineering is then performed to extract relevant features from the concentration data, including temporal patterns, correlations, and contextual factors that influence air quality. The project selects an appropriate machine learning model, such as regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, and trains it using the prepared dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, or R-squared.

Upon successful evaluation, the trained model is deployed to make real-time predictions of the AQI based on the latest concentration data. This enables stakeholders such as environmental agencies, policymakers, and individuals to make informed decisions regarding public health, outdoor activities, and air quality improvement measures.

Overall, the project strives to provide an effective solution for predicting the AQI, empowering users with actionable insights and promoting a healthier environment.
